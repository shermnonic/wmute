TODO
====

Updated: August 8, 2010
Status: (o) open, (w) work-in-progress, (X) done

 o  Check memory deallocation in GL classes
 o  Python scripting support
 o  Texture support
 o  Add shader source path CMake variable which can be used as default shader
    search path during development (avoid manual working directory specification)
 o  Media support via libavbin (Video+Audio)
 o  Resource manager for textures and shaders


Ideas:

* Shader preprocessor w/ good C++ integration:

   - automatically parse in/out resp. sampler/uniform/varying variables
   - automatically parse custom preprocessor macros (like <__opt_WIDTH>)
   - store parsed result in appropriate maps using the corresponding name as key
   - look into GL3 shader semantic
