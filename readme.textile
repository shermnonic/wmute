h1. Wintermute

Code repository of "386dx25":http://www.386dx25.de, started in December 2012.

h3. Assembla Readme Markdown

In assembla you can use "textile(Textile Basics)":http://bit.ly/textile-basics, "html(Html Basics)":http://bit.ly/html-basics or "markdown(Markdown Basics)":http://bit.ly/markdown-basics to add some sugar to your readme files. Just add the extention to your readme file, so we can recognize the markup you want to use!

h3. CMake remarks
* All projects use the "CMake build system":http://www.cmake.org.
* All projects should include cmake/WintermuteCommon.cmake providing some global definitions. For a local environment it should sufficient to adjust the WINTERMUTE_OUTPUT_PATH. It points to the base directory for binary and library outputs which are automatically put in the subfolders /bin and /lib respectively. Wintermute libraries should provide corresponding CMake export() functions.

h3. Unordered TODOs
* check for global WMUTE_BIN_PATH environment variable in CMakeLists
* introduce WMUTE_DATA_PATH define; alternative are links in filesystem
* decide whether to search shaders in data path or locally
* add global INSTALL paths, at least for shared (export) libraries (WMUTE_INSTALL_LIB_DIR)
* add global debug lib postfix (CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX)

h3. Projects to include:
* panorama
* glvidfx (problem with 64bit ffmpeg)
* depthdark
