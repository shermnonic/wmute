A code repository of "386dx25":http://www.386dx25.de, started in December 2012.

h3. Assembla Readme Markdown

In assembla you can use "textile(Textile Basics)":http://bit.ly/textile-basics, "html(Html Basics)":http://bit.ly/html-basics or "markdown(Markdown Basics)":http://bit.ly/markdown-basics to add some sugar to your readme files. Just add the extention to your readme file, so we can recognize the markup you want to use!
